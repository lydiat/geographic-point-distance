# geographic-point-distance


Given the following list of places, use JS to produce a script that orders the locations by distance to [redacted].  You may use whatever geocoding service you’d like, but you will probably find most luck using Google Maps' Geocoding API.

Places:
* Times Square, Manhattan, NY 10036
* 13000 S Dakota 244, Keystone, SD 57751
* 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500
* Golden Gate Bridge, San Francisco, CA 94129
* Stonehenge, A344, Amesbury, Wiltshire SP4 7DE, United Kingdom
* Great Wall of China
* Hollywood Sign, Los Angeles, CA


Bonus points if you’d like to try:
* a visualization of this data in the DOM
* abstracting out the script to take user-supplied input to order the locations by distance to any user-supplied location
